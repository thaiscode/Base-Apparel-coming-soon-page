## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS vanilla
- BEM

### What I learned

I managed to better understand how the structure of a function and the if's works

### Continued development

I believe validations are more effective using regex, but this is still new to me. My focus at the moment is to dig deeper and learn more about the basics of javascript.
